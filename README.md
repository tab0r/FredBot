1. Mission Statement:
===========================================
The FredBot Project seeks to provide resources for physical measurement and data analysis based on Arduino and other open source platforms. All resources are intended to be simple enough for 10-14 year olds to deploy at home, while being sophisticated enough to find a place in university physics labs. 

===========================================
2. Generic Program Structure
===========================================
In general, the FredBot platform is based on modularity. So, each combination of an Arduino (or ATmega), sensing equipment, and data handling equipment will be called a module. Each module has a corresponding folder in the Manifest. All instructions for setting up that module may be found within the folder. All modules approximately consist of five steps. 

I. Program Initialization

II. Wait for input

III. Data recording run

IV. Return to II

V. Break

VI. Data storage and shutdown
